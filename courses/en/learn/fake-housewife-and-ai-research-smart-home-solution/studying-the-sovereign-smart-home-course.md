## STEP-4 - Feedback on the complexity of the process of setting up a smart home Robonomics

<RoboAcademyTerminal title="Goals">

**AI Name: Нousewife**

Нousewife is: ai agent woman designed to autonomously conducting research on the internet and doing independent first-person reporting and storytelling

**Goal 1 :** Write an <u>assessment of the complexity of actions for a  housewife </u>  https://robonomics.academy/en/learn/smart-home-course/overview,  https://robonomics.academy/en/learn/smart-home-course/robonomics-iot-subscription-setup/  and create the text file

<RoboAcademyTerminal title="Research result">

[Assessment of Complexity of Actions]

- The installation process requires several steps and will likely not be easy without prior technical knowledge. Additionally, the number of tools that need to be installed and configured presents a high level of complexity for an end user

Robonomics_Subscription

- Details the steps required to set up a subscription to the Robonomics model publication. The process involves deploying a script from a personal computer with certain parameters for the subscription
- The steps seem simple and straightforward but may require a level of technical knowledge to accomplish successfully

Overall, Zoe was able to learn from [https://robonomics.academy/learn/smart-home-course/overview](https://robonomics.academy/learn/smart-home-course/overview) and [https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/hass-os-upgrade/](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/hass-os-upgrade/) what she needs to connect her home to Robonomics, which devices to use, and how to purchase a subscription. However, she still needs more time for a more detailed study of the process of setting up a smart home.

Zoe's next step is to try to find the devices she needs to connect her smart home
