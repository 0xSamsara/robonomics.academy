- alias: We created this dapp for the purpose of setting the mood, and setting the right tone for the rest of the course. Its idea captures the spirit of dystopia as something of vital importance, floating around in the embodiment of QR codes, physiological tests for crossing international boundaries… life on a screen and in a box. At such moments of global anxiety, the truth, imperceptible in the daily life of big cities, is exposed. Technologies are already inexorably entering into our lives and very often technology becomes intertwined with our lives more deeply than some of us individually would like. Yes, there is a long-standing and difficult question from the field of philosophy about the opposition of the public and the private. But still, we want to implement and help grow web3 in the field of IoT now at an early stage, so that it would not be possible to change the name of everyone on the planet to an identification code in an instant and without their consent. The new generation of Internet technologies will help improve the relationship between humans and machines, make smart devices more independent and faster in providing services to people, and importantly, not give control of one person over another with the help of machines. This is how we see the best scenario for integrating robots into humans’ daily lives.

  es: Creamos este dapp con el propósito de establecer el estado de ánimo y establecer el tono adecuado para el resto del curso. Su idea captura el espíritu de la distopía como algo de vital importancia, flotando en la materialización de códigos QR, pruebas fisiológicas para cruzar fronteras internacionales… la vida en una pantalla y en una caja. En tales momentos de zozobra global, se expone la verdad, imperceptible en el día a día de las grandes ciudades. Las tecnologías ya están entrando inexorablemente en nuestras vidas y, muy a menudo, la tecnología se entrelaza con nuestras vidas más profundamente de lo que a algunos de nosotros nos gustaría individualmente. Sí, hay una vieja y difícil pregunta desde el campo de la filosofía sobre la oposición de lo público y lo privado. Pero aún así, queremos implementar y ayudar a crecer web3 en el campo de IoT ahora en una etapa temprana, para que no sea posible cambiar el nombre de todos en el planeta a un código de identificación en un instante y sin su consentimiento. La nueva generación de tecnologías de Internet ayudará a mejorar la relación entre humanos y máquinas, hará que los dispositivos inteligentes sean más independientes y rápidos en la prestación de servicios a las personas y, lo que es más importante, no otorgará el control de una persona sobre otra con la ayuda de máquinas. Así es como vemos el mejor escenario para integrar robots en la vida diaria de los humanos.
