As a possible solution, we want to introduce, at a basic level, the capabilities of web3 technologies and Robonomics tools for IoT developers and users. This introduction Course was designed to explain the main principles that form the idea of decentralized IoT applications, and also to show the main functions of the Robonomics platform as a parachain within the Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem.

Its idea captures the spirit of dystopia as something of vital importance, floating around in the embodiment of QR codes, physiological tests for crossing international boundaries… life on a screen and in a box. At such moments of global anxiety, the truth, imperceptible in the daily life of big cities, is exposed. Technologies are already inexorably entering into our lives and very often technology becomes intertwined with our lives more deeply than some of us individually would like. Yes, there is a long-standing and difficult question from the field of philosophy about the opposition of the public and the private. But still, we want to implement and help grow web3 in the field of IoT now at an early stage, so that it would not be possible to change the name of everyone on the planet to an identification code in an instant and without their consent. The new generation of Internet technologies will help improve the relationship between humans and machines, make smart devices more independent and faster in providing services to people, and importantly, not give control of one person over another with the help of machines. This is how we see the best scenario for integrating robots into humans’ daily lives.
