        <p>{{$ts('Technology has inexorably entered the everyday life of humankind and very often technology becomes intertwined with our lives more deeply than some of us would like. There is a long-standing and difficult question from the field of philosophy about the opposition of the public and the private parts of human existence. That is why we, in Robonomics, want to implement web3 tools in the IoT field. We want to make it impossible to instantly change the name of every person on the planet to an identification code without the consent of the person.')}}</p>
        <p>{{$ts('Next-generation Internet technologies can help improve the relationship between people and machines, make smart devices more independent and faster in providing services to people, and importantly, make it impossible to take control of all people with the help of machines. This is how we see the best scenario for integrating robots into humans‚Äô daily lives.')}}</p>
